# snap-jsprompt-killer-userscript
This userscript re-enables JS globally(!!!) on Snap! for those who find the enable javascript prompt annoying.

While the solution you're looking to reverse by using this that was imposed was poor please keep in mind that by using this you DO make yourself vulnerable again!!!
USE AT YOUR OWN RISK AND PLEASE READ THE CONTENTS OF THE USERSCRIPT BEFORE USING IT.
